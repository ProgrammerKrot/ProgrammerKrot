 <p><i>Hi! Its me speaking. Do you know I have a large software developing experience? I would be amazed to share it with you! I started programming in 13 and so far I reached WebSummit with my own Startup connected to AI and Machine Learning! You can say touch grass, but I have hobbies too! They are ukulele, Data Science (if you know smth new, please reach out) and business management. Okay, maybe I do need touch grass... However, I applied to the unis and so far got accepted by ESSEC, CentraleSupelec, Paris-Saclay, RHIT, NYIT, Reed and Vrije. I hope to be proud student of UPorto!
