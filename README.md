<p><i>Hey there! It's me speaking. Did you know I have extensive experience in software development? No? Well, now you do! I'd be thrilled to share it with you!  

I started programming at 13 (yes, while other kids were outside playing), and so far, I've made it to WebSummit with my own AI and Machine Learning startup! Pretty cool, right? But wait, there's more!  

You might tell me to touch grass, but surprise—I actually have hobbies! I play the ukulele (not professionally, but still), geek out over Data Science (if you know something mind-blowing, spill the tea), and dabble in business management. Okay, okay... maybe I *do* need to touch grass.  

On the academic side, I applied to several universities and got accepted by ESSEC, CentraleSupélec, Paris-Saclay, RHIT, NYIT, Reed, and Vrije. Now, fingers crossed, I become a proud student at UPorto! 🚀  

Also, fun fact: I can probably debug your soul better than your code. Just saying.
